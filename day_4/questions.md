## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  - allows you to create your own mini script within a script, allowing you to easily call a specific script or "method" you have made.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
- def hello(name)
-  puts "#{name} i am"
- end
- hello(sam)

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
- I did that for above example accidentally but..
- def hello_someone(name)
-  puts "#{name} i am"
- end
- hello_someone(sam)

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
- hello_someone()

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
- none at this point!
