## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
- a hash allows you to store data much like an array, however as an array only uses numbers a hash can store anything like strings or values.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
- pet_store = {fish: 150, cats: 12, dogs 15}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
- zoo['IA'] if puts in a string "#{zoo['IA']}"

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
- states.keys
- states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
- a hash would be good for storing user data like logins possibly,  such as in a case the username "tmaz17" as a key for the value "Ty Mazey" when logging into a website.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
- None at this time, it can be hard to see the full value of a hash since the only examples we see are rather specific/random but the basic concept of how to create, call, and use a hash are clear.
